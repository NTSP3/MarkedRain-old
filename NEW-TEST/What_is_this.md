# What is this?

I think these folders in here are a transition between the time
of my MRainOS based on OctOS, and the time where it gets based
on linux.

Looking at the Makefiles of each of these folders, the main
MRainOS-old Makefile, the older makefiles of MRain-Linux (found
in mrain-linux/old) and the Makefile of MRain-Linux itself,
I think this Makefile got transformed into my current one.

Features like 'make runs' are present in these early files.

Really cool. I also included the binaries I made one year ago
since to compile them, you need to compile GCC on your own,
which takes a lot of time.
